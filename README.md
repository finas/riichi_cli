- **Adjustable AI Speed** - 1s / 3s / 5s / random delay presets in Settings

## Install

```bash
pipx install riichi-mahjong-cli
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install riichi-mahjong-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
riichi
```

Or run from source:

```bash
python main.py
```

The game starts in Chinese by default. Language, time control, and AI speed can be changed in **Settings** (main menu option 7). **Replay** (option 8) lets you review any finished game step by step.

### Akochan AI backend

The repository includes a macOS build of the open-source Akochan engine and its
evaluation parameters. AI-vs-AI spectator mode uses it automatically; the fair
native AI remains the default for human games. You can select it explicitly
with:

```bash
MAHJONG_AI_BACKEND=akochan python main.py
```

Akochan’s legacy pipe mode expects complete initial hands, so use it only for
trusted/offline analysis. In AI-vs-AI spectator mode, `MAHJONG_AI_BACKEND=akochan`
uses the complete recorded deal (oracle mode) because no human is competing;
human games continue to use the fair native backend unless a compatible
masked-state engine is supplied.

You can also provide another MJAI-compatible engine explicitly:

```bash
MAHJONG_AI_COMMAND="python path/to/engine.py" python main.py
```

### Mortal backend

After building the `mortal:latest` Docker image and placing a compatible
four-player checkpoint at `~/Models/mortal/mortal.pth`, start Mortal with:

```bash
MAHJONG_AI_BACKEND=mortal python3 main.py
```

The bundled launcher uses `linux/amd64` for Apple Silicon compatibility and
mounts the model read-only. Set `MORTAL_MODEL_DIR` to use another model
directory, or `MAHJONG_AI_TIMEOUT` to override the default 30-second Mortal
response timeout. Mortal is currently supported for four-player games only.
Mortal players are identified on the board with a `[Mortal]` suffix. Set
`MAHJONG_AI_DISPLAY_NAME` to show a custom checkpoint or engine name instead,
for example `MAHJONG_AI_DISPLAY_NAME="Mortal v4"`.

The command is started once per seat and receives the seat number as its final
argument. Engine events are sent as JSON lines and every response is checked
against the legal actions calculated by this project. If the process is absent,
malformed, or does not answer within two seconds, the built-in strong AI takes
over automatically, so a bad external setup cannot freeze or corrupt a game.

### Learning Mode (Mortal Coach)

Select **Option 9** in the main menu to enter **Learning Mode**.
In this mode:
- All opponents (Seats 1, 2, 3) are AI players.
- Seat 0 (human player) has a background Mortal coach attached.
- On each turn, the coach displays real-time recommendations with **Win Possibility (%)**, **Deal-in Risk (%)**, **Shanten**, **Ukeire**, and top alternative discards.
- The game does **not** auto-play: you retain full manual control over every move and can freely follow or deviate from the advice.
- If the external Mortal engine is not running, the built-in intelligent coach automatically provides the suggestions and probability metrics as fallback.

### Early Hand Route Practice Mode (Option 10)

Select **Option 10** in the main menu to practice opening hand planning (**配牌构想与前巡实战特训**):
1. **Phase 1 (Route Formulation / 配牌定构想)**:
   - Receive a realistic opening deal (配牌 14 tiles) with dora and wind context.
   - Evaluate hand blocks and commit to a strategic route (e.g. *Riichi/Pinfu*, *Tanyao*, *Yakuhai Speed*, *Flush*, *Seven Pairs*, or *Defensive Fold*).
2. **Phase 2 (Play Opening Turns / 前巡实战操作)**:
   - Play through the critical first 6–8 turns with active AI opponents.
   - On each turn, review live 5-block evolution, target route alignment, and Mortal's Q-values and Softmax $P\%$.
3. **Phase 3 (Report Card / 前巡战果诊断与评分)**:
   - View shanten progression (e.g. 4-shanten $\rightarrow$ 1-shanten), block pruning efficiency, and decision concordance rate against Mortal.

## Rule Engine Verification

The repository includes unit tests, full-game invariants, and an optional Tenhou
replay harness. Tenhou XML fixtures are not bundled; place XML files under
`tests/xml/failed/` before running the external replay verification command.

### Verification Process

1. **Parse** Tenhou mjlog XML replay files into structured event streams (draws, discards, melds, riichi, agari, ryuukyoku)
2. **Reconstruct** the exact tile wall order from the replay data (initial hands, draw sequence, dead wall)
3. **Replay** each round step-by-step through our engine, feeding the same actions from the replay
4. **Validate** at every step:
   - Each draw, discard, meld, and riichi is legal according to the engine's rule checks
   - Ron/tsumo legality (furiten, valid yaku, score calculation)
   - Final scoring matches Tenhou's results (fu, han, points, payments)
   - Ryuukyoku (draw) tenpai status and point transfers match

```bash
# Run Tenhou replay verification for XML fixtures supplied locally
pytest tests/tenhou_replay/ -v
```

### What This Proves

- Yaku detection, fu calculation, and scoring are covered by deterministic and full-game tests
- Furiten rules (discard furiten, temporary furiten, riichi furiten) behave correctly
- Meld legality (chi, pon, kan) matches Tenhou's rule interpretation
- Edge cases (haitei, houtei, rinshan, chankan, double riichi) are handled correctly

## Design Highlights

- **Dual Encoding** - 136-encoding tracks unique tile identity, 34-encoding for efficient algorithms
- **GameView Barrier** - AI and human use the same interface, ensuring fairness
- **Strict Layering** - core/engine/rules never import the UI layer; translations live entirely in `ui/`
- **EventBus Logging** - the engine emits events consumed by the game logger; replays are rebuilt from these logs
- **Swappable AI** - Standard interface (a single `choose_action` protocol) allows future AI model integration
- **i18n Architecture** - `t()` translation function with locale dictionaries, yaku names used as stable keys; locale consistency is enforced by tests
- **Invariant Tests** - AI self-play smoke tests assert point conservation after every round

## About This Project

This project was **fully implemented by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)** from scratch. Humans only provided requirement documents — all code, tests, and documentation were generated by AI.

### Implementation Info

| Item | Details |
|------|------|
| AI Tool | Claude Code (Anthropic CLI) |
| Model | Claude Opus 4.6 (`claude-opus-4-6`) |
| Process | Complete code writing and debugging in a single session |
| Scale | ~30 source files, 120 unit tests |
| Tokens | ~200K+ tokens (planning, code generation, test fixing) |
| Date | 2025-02-12 |

### Later Iterations

All subsequent versions were also implemented by Claude Code, including: multilingual interface and PyPI release (v1.1.0), the A+B time control system and settings menu (v1.1.x), the optional Tenhou replay harness, a full engine audit in 2026-06 (fixed tenhou/chankan/kita-dora/riichi-stick-conservation bugs, removed dead code, enforced layering, added LRU caching), the step-by-step game replay feature, and UI improvements (AI riichi tile marker fix, orange red-five tiles, call/ron target highlighting, restructured result screen).
